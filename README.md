# SGGX_TAA

## Project for my Bachelors Thesis combining the SGGX Distribution with Temporal Anti-Alilasing

### Build

To build there some dependencies need to be installed, at least:
 - GLEW
 - GLFW
 - glm


Also note: The code in this project is at times pretty terrible and the user experience also pretty bad. I don't actually recommend anyone to use this code.
